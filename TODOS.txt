# TODO List - Skin Cancer Feature Networks Project

## Brynn – Data, MGM, Part of Writing

### Setup & Infrastructure
- [ ] Set up the project repo structure (skin-cancer-feature-networks) and basic src/ layout

### Data Processing
- [ ] Load the PAD-UFES-20 dataset and perform data cleaning / preprocessing
- [ ] Define benign vs malignant subsets
- [ ] Implement mixed-type encoding for variables (continuous / ordinal / categorical)

### MGM Analysis
- [ ] Implement MGM + StARS for benign and malignant networks
- [ ] Compute network metrics for MGM networks (centrality, communities, etc.)
- [ ] Run bootstrap and build consensus graphs for MGM networks

### Writing - Methods
- [ ] Draft Methods section: Dataset description
- [ ] Draft Methods section: Preprocessing and encoding
- [ ] Draft Methods section: MGM + StARS

### Writing - Results
- [ ] Draft Results section: Undirected (MGM) networks and their metrics/stability
- [ ] Contribute to Results: benign vs malignant comparison (MGM side)

### Writing - Other
- [ ] Contribute to Discussion and Future work (first pass)
- [ ] Do a final editorial pass on the full report (flow, consistency, typos)

### Presentation / Slides
- [ ] Draft slides for: Project Goal + Motivation
- [ ] Draft slides for: Dataset Summary
- [ ] Draft slides for: MGM Results (graphs + interpretation)
- [ ] Draft slides for: Benign vs Malignant comparison (MGM side)
- [ ] Draft slides for: Discussion (first pass)
- [ ] Prepare notes for your speaking sections

## Stephane – Causal Models, Bootstrap, Figures, Part of Writing

### Causal Inference Implementation
- [ ] Implement PC-Stable for benign and malignant networks (mixed CI tests, CPDAG)
- [ ] Implement GES with conditional-Gaussian BIC for benign and malignant
- [ ] Implement NOTEARS on the continuous subset for benign and malignant

### Bootstrap for Causal Models
- [ ] Implement bootstrap and consensus logic for causal models (PC/GES, possibly NOTEARS)

### Writing - Methods
- [ ] Draft Methods section: Causal models (PC-Stable, GES, NOTEARS)
- [ ] Draft Methods section: Bootstrapping and consensus procedure for directed graphs

### Writing - Results
- [ ] Draft Results section: Causal networks, edge directions, and stability
- [ ] Draft Results section: Agreement / disagreement between PC, GES, and NOTEARS
- [ ] Contribute to Results: benign vs malignant comparison (causal side)

### Writing - Other
- [ ] Contribute to Discussion and Future work (focus on causal interpretation)

### Figures & Tables
- [ ] Prepare final figures and tables (≤ 6 figures):
  - [ ] Final network plots (benign/malignant, MGM + causal)
  - [ ] Stability / difference plots
- [ ] Ensure captions and formatting are ready for the report

### Presentation / Slides
- [ ] Draft slides for: Project Goal + Motivation
- [ ] Draft slides for: Dataset Summary
- [ ] Draft slides for: Causal Results (PC-Stable, GES, NOTEARS graphs + interpretation)
- [ ] Draft slides for: Benign vs Malignant comparison (causal side)
- [ ] Draft slides for: Discussion (first pass)
- [ ] Prepare notes for your speaking sections
