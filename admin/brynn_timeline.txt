==========================================
BRYNN TIMELINE – SKIN CANCER FEATURE NETWORKS
Dec 2, 2024 → Jan 5, 2025
==========================================

------------------------------------------
PHASE 1 – SETUP, DATA, ENCODING (Dec 2–8)
------------------------------------------

By Dec 4:
[ ] Set up the full project repo structure (skin-cancer-feature-networks)
[ ] Create folders: src/, data/raw/, data/interim/, data/processed/, results/, reports/
[ ] Place PAD-UFES-20 dataset into data/raw/

By Dec 8:
[ ] Load PAD-UFES-20 dataset and perform data cleaning
[ ] Handle missing values, standardize categories, basic sanity checks
[ ] Define benign vs malignant subsets and save to data/processed/
[ ] Implement mixed-type encoding (continuous/ordinal/categorical) in encoding_utils.py
[ ] Optional: Run quick EDA notebook for distributions, missingness, correlations


------------------------------------------
PHASE 2 – MGM ANALYSIS CORE (Dec 9–15)
------------------------------------------

By Dec 12:
[ ] Implement MGM + StARS for benign and malignant networks
[ ] Save adjacency matrices in results/mgm/
[ ] Compute network metrics (degree, betweenness, eigenvector, communities)

By Dec 15:
[ ] Implement bootstrap procedure for MGM networks
[ ] Generate edge selection frequencies for benign + malignant
[ ] Build MGM consensus graphs using threshold (e.g., 0.7)
[ ] Begin drafting Methods notes:
       - Dataset description
       - Preprocessing + encoding
       - MGM + StARS methods


------------------------------------------
PHASE 3 – WRITING YOUR REPORT SECTIONS (Dec 16–22)
------------------------------------------

Methods Sections:
[ ] Write Methods: Dataset description
[ ] Write Methods: Preprocessing and encoding decisions
[ ] Write Methods: MGM + StARS approach

Results Sections:
[ ] Write Results: Undirected (MGM) networks
[ ] Describe network metrics (centrality, communities)
[ ] Describe bootstrap stability results
[ ] Add MGM-focused contribution to Benign vs Malignant comparison

Discussion + Future Work:
[ ] Add MGM-focused insights to Discussion
[ ] Add suggestions for Future Work (MGM + data side)

Goal: Full draft of your contributions finished by Dec 22.


------------------------------------------
PHASE 4 – REPORT POLISH + SUBMISSION (Dec 23–30)
------------------------------------------

Dec 23–26 (Light Work):
[ ] Tighten Methods: Data, Preprocessing, MGM
[ ] Ensure MGM Results text matches actual figures
[ ] Help condense the report to 5–6 pages

Dec 27–29:
[ ] Finalize MGM-related figures with captions
[ ] Ensure figures are referenced properly in text
[ ] Do a full editorial pass on the report for:
       - Flow
       - Clarity
       - Typos and grammar
[ ] Verify reproducibility of MGM pipeline

Dec 30:
[ ] Final read-through of your sections
[ ] Confirm all MGM outputs exist in results/
[ ] Submit final PDF + code with partner


------------------------------------------
PHASE 5 – PRESENTATION PREP (Jan 2–5)
------------------------------------------

Jan 2:
[ ] Draft your slides:
       - Project motivation & goal
       - Dataset summary
       - MGM methods overview
       - MGM results (benign vs malignant)
       - Comparison slide (MGM perspective)

Jan 3:
[ ] Add speaker notes to your slides
[ ] First practice run together (~10–12 mins total; ~5–6 mins for you)

Jan 4:
[ ] Clean up slides (visual clarity, less text)
[ ] Final practice run

Jan 5:
[ ] Present
